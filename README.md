# Game of Life

Autonomy AI demo by Neal Wojtowicz. In this project, I recreated the game of life from John Conway in the Unity engine utilizing double buffering. Each tile that is lit up green is considered alive and every tile that is black is considered dead. If a tile is not alive and has three alive neighbors next to it, the tile will come alive. If the tile is alive and it has two or three neighbors, it will continue to stay alive. However, if there is zero or one neighbors, the tile dies by solitude and if there is more than 3 neighbors, the tile will die from overpopulation. This is meant to be a zero player simulation without any player input.
